# SME-Assignment
Part1:
I was able to complete part one which includes installation of sfml and visual studio code then I resolve the error or bug from the code by adding std::cerr to initialize the game setup 
after this the space-invader.exe file was created in x64/debug folder then I added all the necessary ddl from the bin for debugging. Now I am able to access the game with sound and effect everything 
Part 2
Then I made some required changes in Enemycontroller and Playercontroller source code and added a bullet.h directory in the header to add the bullets in enemyship as well as playership
Now the game is ready to play
